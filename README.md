 An analytical interplay between land surface temperature with forest cover deforestation



The concepts of change detection analysis is not new, the emergence of new imaging sensors and geospatial technologies has created a need for image processing techniques that can integrate observation from a variety of different sensors and datasets to map, detect and monitor forest resources. In addition to timber, forests provide such resources as grazing land for animals, wildlife habitat, water resources and recreation areas and these are threatened constantly by both human impacts like forest fires, air pollution, clearing for agricultural uses, and illegal cutting. Farming activities, continued sand winning operations and the allocation of plots of land to prospective developers in and around the catchments of the Owabi dam pose a serious threat to the forest covers and the lifespan of the dam. The overall objective of this study is to map out and analyse the structural changes of forest cover using Landsat images of the study area. Here I calculate vegetation index NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), anthropogenic activities in the study area. An NDVI analysis was performed on these images and it was noted that there was no significant difference between the NDVI classification and the supervised classification of the images. Overlay of the reserved forest of 2018 and the classified map of 2023 shows vegetation changed during 2018-2023 remarkably.
